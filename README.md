# Google REST Fit API Spike

This repo retrieves step activity data from Google Fit's API. 

The step data will display in the terminal through postman when making a GET request to http://localhost:5000/api/google.

The code I wrote for this repo can be found in the server.js file. I used a previously existing giphy API repo to start my project, so the index.js and app.js contain information from that.
